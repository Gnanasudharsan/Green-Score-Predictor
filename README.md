# Green Score Predictor for AI Models ðŸŒ±

## Abstract

As machine learning models grow in size and complexity, their energy consumption and carbon footprint have become major concerns. The **Green Score Predictor** aims to empower AI developers, researchers, and engineers to make more **sustainable AI** decisions. By estimating the energy consumption and carbon impact of various machine learning models based on training parameters (such as hardware used, dataset size, and training time), this tool helps users understand and minimize their AI models' environmental impact. The app also provides actionable suggestions for optimizing the modelâ€™s green score by recommending energy-efficient alternatives.

## Problem Statement

With the rapid advancements in AI, training large models (such as GPT, BERT, etc.) has become a significant contributor to energy consumption, resulting in a growing carbon footprint. Despite the importance of environmental sustainability, many AI practitioners are unaware of the energy costs involved in training their models. This lack of visibility makes it difficult to make informed decisions about resource-efficient AI model training.

## Output

The **Green Score Predictor** outputs the following results:
- **Estimated Energy Usage** in kilowatt-hours (kWh)
- **Estimated COâ‚‚ Emissions** in kilograms (kg COâ‚‚e)
- **Green Score** (Aâ€“E) indicating the sustainability of the model
- **Optimization Suggestions**:
  - Energy-efficient model alternatives (e.g., switching from BERT to DistilBERT)
  - Hardware usage optimizations
